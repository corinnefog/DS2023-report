## Player Performance Metrics

| **Metric**                  | **Description** |
|----------------------------|-----------------|
| Position                   | The playerâ€™s role on the team (e.g., Guard, Forward, Center), which influences movement patterns and workload. |
| Period Number              | The specific segment of the game or practice session being recorded. |
| Total Player Load          | A cumulative measure of the physical workload experienced by a player during a session. |
| Player Load Per Minute     | Player load normalized per minute to account for differences in playing time. |
| IMA Accel Total            | The total number of inertial movement accelerations across all intensity levels. |
| IMA Decel Total            | The total number of inertial movement decelerations across all intensity levels. |
| Explosive Efforts          | The number of high-intensity movements, such as quick sprints or jumps. |
| Session Total Jump         | The total number of jumps performed by a player during the session. |
| Session Jumps Per Minute   | The number of jumps a player performs per minute, useful for workload analysis. |
| Total High IMA             | The total number of high-intensity inertial movement activities, capturing rapid changes in motion. |
