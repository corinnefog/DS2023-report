# Report
## Prepared for
Prepared for the University of Virginia Men's Basketball program. This report is intended to support coaches and athletic trainers in making informed decisions based on player workload data collected through Catapult wearable technology.

## Problem Statement
In basketball, performance is more than raw effort. Every sprint, jump, and cut adds to the physical toll players experience. What if success has less to do with how much energy is used, and more to do with when and how it is applied?
This report uses two seasons of Catapult data to investigate whether patterns in workload and effort explain differences in team performance. Our goal was to uncover patterns that could guide coaching strategies related to training, rest, and in-game effort.
We focused on three guiding questions. First, do workload patterns vary by position and game outcome? Second, how does intensity change across the season? Third, can explosive effort tell us anything about player readiness and team momentum?

## Analysis
We started  by reviewing all the player load data across both seasons. Then we focused on three variables. These were average player load by position, player load per
minute each week, and explosive efforts during games. Our goal was to find a story in the data that coaches could use to make informed decisions about training and
strategy. When we looked at player load by position, we saw that guards and forwards tended to have lower average loads in games that ended in wins. Centers had about
the same load whether the team won or lost. This suggests that efficient and well-paced effort leads to better outcomes. It also suggests adjusting intensity by 
position in both practice and in-game strategy. When looking at weekly load per minute, we found that Season 2 had much higher levels of effort between Weeks 11 and 
21. During that time, the team had a stronger win record compared to the same section in Season 1. This might suggest that higher physical intensity in the middle of 
the season improved overall fitness.

## Conclusion
Our findings highlight a key pattern. The team's strongest performances often came during periods when effort was managed with intention rather than sustained at a constant high level.
Guards and forwards had lower average player loads in games that ended in wins, which suggests that pacing and role-based effort matter. Load per minute increased mid-season and corresponded with stronger results, highlighting the value of training intensity that rises at the right times. Explosive effort patterns also appeared to align with wins and losses, offering possible early indicators of momentum or fatigue.
This all points to one story. Winning is often achieved not by exerting more effort, but by directing effort more intentionally. This includes personalized load management and strategic practice planning.Â Moving forward, coaches can use these metrics to spot early signs of burnout, plan smarter practices, and adjust training intensity to prepare for key parts of the season. This data is a blueprint for better planning and long-term player readiness.
