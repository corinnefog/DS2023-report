# Report
## Prepared for
Prepared for the University of Virginia Men's Basketball program. This report is intended to support coaches and athletic trainers in making informed decisions based on player workload data collected through Catapult wearable technology.

## Problem Statement
In basketball, performance is more than raw effort. Every sprint, jump, and cut adds to the physical toll players experience. This report uses two seasons of Catapult data to investigate whether patterns in workload and effort explain differences in team performance. Our goal was to uncover patterns that could guide coaching strategies related to training, rest, and in-game effort.
We focused on three guiding questions. First, do workload patterns vary by position and game outcome? Second, how does intensity change across the season? Third, can explosive effort tell us anything about player readiness and team momentum?

## Analysis
We began by using a heat map to track how player load per minute changed each week between the two seasons. Red shading shows where Season 2 had higher intensity than Season 1, while blue indicates the opposite. The trend reveals that weeks 11 through 21 in Season 2 had consistently higher player load per minute, with the biggest spikes in weeks 14 and 21. During this time, the team in Season 2 achieved a stronger overall record compared to the same stretch in Season 1.  This suggests that a mid-season rise in physical demand may contribute to improved performance.

## Conclusion
Our findings highlight a key pattern. The team's strongest performances often came during periods when effort was managed with intention rather than sustained at a constant high level.
Guards and forwards had lower average player loads in games that ended in wins, which suggests that pacing and role-based effort matter. Load per minute increased mid-season and corresponded with stronger results, highlighting the value of training intensity that rises at the right times. Explosive effort patterns also appeared to align with wins and losses, offering possible early indicators of momentum or fatigue.
This all points to one story. Winning is often achieved not by exerting more effort, but by directing effort more intentionally. This includes personalized load management and strategic practice planning.Â Moving forward, coaches can use these metrics to spot early signs of burnout, plan smarter practices, and adjust training intensity to prepare for key parts of the season. This data is a blueprint for better planning and long-term player readiness.
