# Report
## Prepared for
Prepared for the University of Virginia Men's Basketball program. This report is intended to support coaches and athletic trainers in making informed decisions based on player workload data collected through Catapult wearable technology.

## Problem Statement
In basketball, performance is more than raw effort. Every sprint, jump, and cut adds to the physical toll players experience. This report uses two seasons of Catapult data to investigate whether patterns in workload and effort explain differences in team performance. Our goal was to uncover patterns that could guide coaching strategies related to training, rest, and in-game effort.
We focused on three guiding questions. First, do workload patterns vary by position and game outcome? Second, how does intensity change across the season? Third, can explosive effort tell us anything about player readiness and team momentum?

## Analysis
We began by using a heat map to track how player load per minute changed each week between the two seasons. Red shading shows where Season 2 had higher intensity than Season 1, while blue indicates the opposite. The trend reveals that weeks 11 through 21 in Season 2 had consistently higher player load per minute, with the biggest spikes in weeks 14 and 21. During this time, the team in Season 2 achieved a stronger overall record compared to the same stretch in Season 1.  This suggests that a mid-season rise in physical demand may contribute to improved performance.

The second graph expands on this by showing player load by position across both seasons on the day before game day. The Season 2 dots appear to be higher than those from Season 1, with notable increases of over 25% across all positions. Centers experienced a 72.8% increase in load before games in Season 2.  This suggests that players may have been entering games more fatigued, which could affect in-game performance and recovery. Strategic reduction of pre-game intensity, especially for high-load positions, may improve performance outcomes.

We also compared average player load by position in wins versus losses across both seasons. Guards consistently had lower loads in games that ended in wins, while centers showed less variation. The pattern interestingly flipped for forwards between seasons. In Season 1, lower player load was associated with wins, but in Season 2, the opposite was observed. This shift may be explained by an almost complete roster change at the forward position between the 2022 and 2023 seasons. These findings highlight how efficiency and pacing are tied to performance, while also showing that changes in player rosters can reshape how effort translates to outcomes.

## Conclusion
These patterns support the idea that managing workload is not just about limiting effort but distributing it strategically throughout the season and around game days. Coaches can use this insight to better structure training and recovery in ways that align with peak performance periods. This may include personalized load management, smarter practice planning, and intentional rest built into the season schedule. Outcomes are influenced more by the strategic application of effort than by its intensity alone. These findings can inform training and recovery strategies that enhance performance and support consistent player output across the season.
