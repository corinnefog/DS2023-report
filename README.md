Our project takes a look at player load data collected on a collegiate basketball team through Catapult technology. We compared 2 seasons of data, examining Player load before and during games to see how it effected the success of the game. We learned that during games, player load was lower when they won that when they lost. We also learned how to prepare information for stakeholders. This project was pertinent to our career because we learned how to analye a large dataset, find patterns, and produce a tangible product.
